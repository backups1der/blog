yep, this was the coolest name i got from my friends when i asked about this blog's name <small>uhhuh, best name i got was literally just *block* ._.</small>.

it was actually called "blok", but uh  
i am a turkish entity who has turkish "friends", so considering that and the turkish translation, i *slightly* modified the name and took it.

hey dont look at me like that-

## what are you even developing, you just have your theme ready <u>bruh</u>-
lots of things. for example:  
- custom functionality (shortcodes) and styling for them
- better (and *k*ooler) home page
- more *k*ontent
- better ux

jokes aside,
