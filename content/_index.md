  welcome to my little corner of the internet where i share my shitty thoughts, ideas and projects.

  i am the guy that wrote stuff here, added a few custom functionaity and ~~wrote~~ stole some styling from my friends' blogs that used this very same theme.

  <div class="buttons start big">
    <a href="#welcome" class="suggested">welcome↓</a>
    <a href="/about#right" class="">about me -></a>
  </div>
  </div>
</div>

## welcome to <span class="rainbow">blo(c)k</span> {#welcome}
yep, this was the coolest name i got from my friends when i asked about this blog's name <small>uhhuh, best name i got was literally just *block* ._.</small>.

it was actually called "blok", but uh  
i am a turkish entity who has turkish "friends", so considering that and the turkish translation, i *slightly* modified the name and took it.

hey dont look at me like that-

## what are you even developing, you just have your theme ready *bruh*-
lots of things. for example:  
- custom functionality (shortcodes) and styling for them
- better (and *k*ooler) home page
- more *k*ontent
- better ux

jokes aside,

  <summary>my missions</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>relaxing out (by creating pain)</li>
    <li>create a free and comfortable place that i could share my thoughts</li>
    <li>gain experience (what is this, minecraft?)</li>
    <li>give that <span class="spoiler">fucking</span> teacher a big fat middle finger, <i>that one teacher</i> i hate 😀</li>
  </ul>
